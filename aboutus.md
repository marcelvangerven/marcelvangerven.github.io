Naturally Intelligent Systems is a spinoff company of the Artificial Cognitive Systems Lab at the Donders Institute, the Netherlands. Throught the spinoff company we bring our advances in scientific machine learning, edge AI and neuromorphic computing to tackle challenges in industry, society and science.

    Monitoring, prediction and control algorithms
We provide advanced AI solutions for prediction and control rooted in scientific machine learning. These solutions are ideal for simulation, monitoring, early detection, metrology, predictive maintenance and control of complex systems across a wide range of domains such as high-tech industry, healthcare and automotive.
Edge AI solutions
Using a unique software/hardware co-optimization approach we provide edge AI solutions for embedded systems. Our proprietary software allows for rapid deployment of neural networks on programmable hardware offering minimal energy use and extremely high throughput.
On-Chip Learning and Inference platform
We provide a unique approach for on-chip learning and inference that runs completely independent of the cloud. This solution is ideal for applications that cannot or do not wish to make use of external AI solutions since all of the intelligence runs locally on chip.
