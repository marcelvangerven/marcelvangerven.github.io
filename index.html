Modern AI systems are powerful yet do not always fit well with contemporary industrial, societal and scientific needs. Cybernetic Intelligence (CI) develops embedded AI solutions for critical operations in high-tech systems that require high accuracy and high throughput at minimal energy use. We achieve this using a unique software/hardware co-optimization approach that builds on decades of research in artificial intelligence.
